- Add support for showing where header files included in the queries.  Already extracting the
  necessary data from the collect phase.

- Convert from source or header to object file in the necessary queries.  For example, this would
  mean that a user could use sock.cpp to query for the leaks or interface of sock.o.  Again, the
  data is already in the graph from the collect phase.
