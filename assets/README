These are patches that are applied to SCons to get the libdeps, since the LIBDEPS variable is an extension we added to the build system.

This is a hack and should go away when we have better integration with SCons, or at least a separate file that does this for us.

Files:

- print_scons_libdeps.patch - patch that works on 3.0.0 and beyond (used by the scripts)
- print_scons_libdeps_26.patch - patch that works on 2.5.5 and beyond
- print_scons_libdeps_24.patch - patch that works on 2.4.9 and beyond
